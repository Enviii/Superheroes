# Superheroes!

### About
This project is about superheroes from both Marvel and DC displayed stored with JSON and displayed using HTML and JS. I picked 10 from Marvel and 10 from DC in no particular order. Just 20 heroes that I personally like and thought were mainstream.

### Libraries

This project is pretty straight forward. I use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I have imported Jquery for the JSON feed as well as for styling. I have also added Typeahead.js to autocomplete the search for the Superhero property. It has not been implemented for the other properties.
