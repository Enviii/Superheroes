# Superheroes!

### About
This project is about superheroes from both Marvel and DC displayed stored with JSON and displayed using HTML and JS. I picked 10 from Marvel and 10 from DC in no particular order. Just 20 heroes that I personally like and thought were mainstream.

### Libraries
This project is pretty straight forward. I use HTML5, CSS3, and JS. I have also implemented Jquery for the JSON feeds and various other functions as well as Typeahead.js for auto completing certain elements in the search bar. 

### The files
* index.html
* README.md
* js
   * superheroes.json
   * script.js
   * typeahead.min.js
* css
   *  style.css
   *  ComicBook
      * ComicBook.ttf
      * Font License.txt

css/ComicBook contains font used throughout the website. Everything else is self explanatory.


### Future

* More superheroes
* Add more details for the superheroes
* Wildcard search ('bat' would find 'batman')
* Activating Typeahead.js for each category.
