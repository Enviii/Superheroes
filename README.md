# Superheroes!

### About
This project is about superheroes from both Marvel and DC displayed stored with JSON and displayed using HTML and JS. I picked 10 from Marvel and 10 from DC in no particular order. Just 20 heroes that I personally like and thought were mainstream.

### Libraries
This project is pretty straight forward. I use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I haven't implemented anything special (yet).

### The files

There aren't many files here. There is a main index.html page that is the home for everything. CSS is contained within style.css and the img folder contains all of the images for the superheroes. The JS is contained within script.js and the JSON is in superheroes.json

### Future

* More superheroes
* Add more details for the superheroes
* Better categories/searching functionality
